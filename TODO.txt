TODO
- Implement batch mode in main.py
- Add examples to the Help/Examples menu
- Try other least squares engines (ceres)
- Improve behavior of Original/Optimized netlist text boxes
    - Make Optimized editable and show line in status bar
    - If Optimized is selected, use optimized as initial,
    - If Original is selected use original as initial
    - Save optimized & original in separate variables in app_state
- Fix enable/disable of the Copy to Original button (enable it only when optimization is done)
- Add menu checkbox to enable or disable printing debug messages
- Find a GUI way to display the resulting transfer functions
- Add GUI options under Figure menu to change colors and linespecs of plots
- Split Engine class that is too big
    - Split functions into files but not into different classes
    - See how this is done in other Python projects (eg. Scipy)

Future additions:
- Nonlinear DC analysis
- Linear NOISE analysis
- Simple BJT, MOSFET & Diode models (DC nonlinear, AC linear)
- Filter design tool (poles & zeros from Butterworth, Chebychev and others)
- Transient analysis (nonlinear)
    - Combine it with simple "discrete event simulator" to avoid having to implement variable timestep
    - Figure out a framework to specify optimization goals for transient simulation

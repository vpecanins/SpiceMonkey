TODO
- Add examples to the Help/Examples menu
- Debug behavior of Original/Optimized netlist text boxes
- Implement case sensitivity in netlist
- Regularization: Use "original" instead of "initial"
- Find a GUI way to display the resulting transfer functions
- Add GUI options under Figure menu to change colors and linespecs of plots

Future additions:
- Schematic editor
- Nonlinear DC analysis
- Linear NOISE analysis
- Try other least squares engines (ceres)
- Simple BJT, MOSFET & Diode models (DC nonlinear, AC linear)
- Filter design tool (poles & zeros from Butterworth, Chebychev and others)
- CTDSM loop filter design tool
- Transient analysis (nonlinear)
    - Combine it with simple "discrete event simulator" to avoid having to implement variable timestep
    - Figure out a framework to specify optimization goals for transient simulation
- Split Engine class that is too big
    - Split functions into files but not into different classes
    - See how this is done in other Python projects (eg. Scipy)
